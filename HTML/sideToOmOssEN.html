                <h3>Economics</h3>
                <p>As a student, the economical situation isn’t always the very best. 
                    You get advised to set up a monthly bugdet for every outcome, every income, 
                    and of course you need to think of the unforseen spendings that mat occur throughout
                     the month. Even though this helps for most people, many still want to save some money
                      where they can.  </p>

                <p>Students do also have some «student-discounts». Unfortunate, these discounts
                     does not apply to daily, overall spendings on groceries. This will lead to high
                      expenses on something that is most vital for a human, everyday meals. </p>

                <h3>Food waste</h3>
                <p>One of FN’s Sustainable Development Goals, 
                    number 12.3 which concerns food waste, want to halve the 
                    food waste measured in kilos per inhabitant, applying to 
                    the groceries-industries and to the consumers. </p>

                <p>FN has estimated that roughly one third of all the food we consume never gets eaten.
                     In 2017, Østfoldsforskning measured in a reasearch they did on food waste, that every
                      inhabitant in Norway that year threw away 73 kilos of edible food. This amount of food
                       waste equals 22 billion Norwegian kroners when measured in kroners, and an climate-emission
                        of 1.3 million CO2-equivalents per year. 42 kiloes of the total amount of 73 kiloes,
                         were thrown away by Norwegian householdings. In other words, the householdings struggle 
                         the most on keeping food waste to a minimum.   </p>

                <br>

                <p>The outcome of the research Østfoldforskning did in 2017, showed that 20% of the
                     total edible food waste contained bread and pasteries. Casserole-dishes did have
                      an outcome at 19%, while fruit and vegetables scored 18%. </p>
                
                <br>

                <p>CoMeals wishes to contribiute to achieve the goal for halve food waste in 2030. 
                    We do think that making lunch and other dishes to eachother will help reduce the
                     amount of food waste, through becomming more observant on how much food you need 
                     for a small group, and that you don’t make more than necessary. We do also believe 
                     that making food is a social activity, and that CoMeals can facilitate so people not
                      only get to experience new food, but also making contact with other fellowmen. </p>
