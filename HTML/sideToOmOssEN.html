            <p><b>Among the expectations of young students in today's society are, 
                earning good grades and doing voluntary after-school work, prioritizing friends and family, and being involved in the climate-change debate. Expectations are close to some of the problems students may face: poor finances, loneliness, and high food wastage.</b></p>

            <br>

            <h3>Economics</h3>
            <p>From our own experience, we at COmeals know that it is difficult to always remember lunch packages, especially with early lectures, often leading to us buying something in the canteen. According to our survey, 38% of students spend between 100 and 300 kroner each week on food in the cafeteria, which indicates a relatively high consumption.</p>
            
            <p>It is a known stereotype that students have little money. Furthermore, more than 30% of the students in Norway have paid work in addition to studying according to Anna-Lena Keute (2017). Thus, despite a busy study day, part-time jobs are important sources of income for many students in Norway. Paid work may have a negative impact on the time that students spend on schoolwork (Keute, 2017), and that by saving more money one can focus on the academic or do other hobbies instead of working.  </p>
            
            <p> For those who do not have part-time jobs, tight budgets may then be necessary to manage only with the student loan. Setting up a monthly budget can be of great help, in addition to various student discounts that can help students buy cheaper goods in some shops or restaurants. Unfortunatly, these discounts usually do not apply to daily, overall spendings on groceries. From our survey, however, we see that most students wants to save even more money each month, see the diagram below.</p>

            <h3>Food waste</h3>
            <p>One of FN’s Sustainable Development Goals, 
            number 12.3 which concerns food waste, wants to half the 
            food waste measured in kilos per inhabitant, applying to 
            the groceries-industries and to the consumers (United Nations, 2015). </p>

            <br>

            <div class="sideToPics">
                <div class="descriptionPic">
                    <img src="../pics/diagramNO.jpg" alt="Chart of food waste measured in kilograms.">
                    <p>Figure 2. «Graph over food-waste measured in kilograms», Stensgård, 2019.</p>

                    <p >Description of the picture above from the left: <b>Primary sector:</b> not measured,
                    <b>Foodindustry:</b> 17,9 kilograms, <b>Wholesaler:</b> 1,2 kilograms, <b>Cafès and restaurants:</b> not measured, <b>Hotels and cafeterias:</b> 1,8 kilograns, 
                    <b>Grocerystores:</b> 9,9 kilograms, <b>Householdings:</b> 42,1 kilograms." </p>

            </div>   

            <p>FN has estimated that roughly one third of all the food we consume never gets eaten (Stensgård, 2019). In 2017, Østfoldsforskning measured in a reasearch they did on food waste, that every inhabitant in Norway that year threw away 73 kilos of edible food. This amount of food waste equals 22 billion Norwegian kroners, and a climate-emission of 1.3 million CO2-equivalents per year. From the total amount of 73 kilos, 42 kilos were thrown away by Norwegian householdings. In other words, the householdings struggle 
            the most on keeping food waste at a minimum. </p>

            <br>

            <div class="sideToPics">
                <img src="../pics/cirkelDiagramNO.png" alt="Chart of food waste measured in percent.">
                <p><p>Figure 3. «Cirkeldiagram over groceries registeredd as food waste, measured in percentage», Stensgård, 2019.</p>
                <!-- Picture taken from: http://www.ntfe.no/i/2019/2/tfe-2019-02b-1395 -->
            </div>  

            <br>

            <p>The outcome of the research Østfoldforskning did in 2017, showed that 20% of the total edible food waste contained bread and pasteries (Stensgård, 2019). Casserole-dishes did have an outcome at 19%, while fruit and vegetables scored 18%.</p> 
            <p>As we have experienced ourselves as students, it is challenging to eat up all the leftovers of what is purchased. This is partly because as a student, you often cook alone and the food may become mouldering before you manage to eat it, you are poor at planning meals or you grow tired of eating leftovers. </p>
            
            <br>

            <h3>Solitude</h3>
            <p>In a studenthealth- and satisfaction survey from Folkehelseinstituttet,
                the answers show that close to one third of the students in the survey are experiencing loneliness 
                “often” or “very often” in one or more ways (Solvang & Gildestad, 2018). 23% says that they “often” or “very often” are missing someone to be with, 17% says that they “often” or “very often” are feeling left out, and 16% says that they “often” or “very often” are feeling left out. From our survey we can also see that 80% of the students that participated wants to get to know new people by cooperating on making lunch. Lunch is an important meal during a schoolday, and the fact that one may eat alone means that students lose the opportunity to socialize and make new acquaintances.
                </p>
        
            <br>

            <p>Being able to help students with poor finances is important from a social
                perspective because it can ease the pressure students feel in a busy everyday life.
                We also want COmeals to bring students together to reduce the proportion of lonely students,
                and to help the environment by reducing food waste. </p>
